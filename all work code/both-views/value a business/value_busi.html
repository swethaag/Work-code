                        A company is held by two categories of owners, shareholders and debt holders. The value of a pure business which accrues to both categories of owners is called the Enterprise Value, whereas the value which accrues just to shareholders is the Equity Value (also called market cap for listed companies). Companies are compared using the enterprise value instead of equity value as debt and cash levels may vary significantly even between companies in the same industry. During an acquisition, depending on whether it is an asset purchase or a stock purchase, valuation of appropriate elements of the business needs to be carried out.

                       The three common approaches of valuing a company are described below:

                      </div>

                      <div class=" ">
                        <div class="row px-4">

                          </div>
                          <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
                            <div class="py-1 "> 
                                It is widely believed that DCF is the best method to estimate the fair value of a company/business. As one would expect, the value of any company is the sum of the cash flows that it produces in the future, discounted to the present at an appropriate rate. The discount rate used is the appropriate Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) that reflects the risk of the cash flows.

                                As per the Efficient Market Hypothesis at any given time, stock prices fully reflect all available information on a particular company and industry. Therefore trading companies provide the best estimate for valuing a similar company. Average multiples such as P/E, EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, P/B, etc. are calculated from all companies similar to the one being valued and the same used to calculate its enterprise value.

                                Investment bankers widely use this method to value a company during an acquisition. Technically this method is similar to trading comps and uses multiples such as P/E, EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, P/B, etc. But the comparables used are companies which have previously undergone a takeover, rather peers which trade on the stock market. Takeovers generally value the company higher because of a control premium paid by the acquirer.

                            Our online valuation tool performs Trading Comparables method of valuation using data from thousands of listed firms in India and other emerging markets to provide a quick ball park valuation for your company within seconds. Private companies tend to have a lower valuation compared to public companies because of illiquidity and inherent riskiness with private companies. A discount factor of 20-30% is common to arrive at the valuation if the company being valued is small compared to an average listed firm in that space. Our customized valuation report provides details of all the comparable companies used along with multiples and their market cap. We also help you refine the valuation for your company by letting you choose comparable companies which best represent your business.

                            EV/sales gives investors an idea of how much it costs to buy the company's sales. Generally the lower the EV/sales the more attractive or undervalued the company is believed to be. A high EV/Sales is not always a bad thing as it can be a sign that investors believe the future sales will greatly increase. A lower EV/sales can signal that the future sales prospects are not very attractive. It is important to compare the measure to that of other companies in the industry, and to look deeper into the company you are analyzing.
