									<p>I was working on my startup idea pre-Covid, but due to lack of funds and the pandemic, we had to shut down our operations. I wanted to sell my business as a shell company that was incorporated as a private limited legal entity. Through some internet research, I came across SMERGERS, which is an online platform that helps business owners and investors connect. The onboarding process was very smooth. Within the first 2-3 months I received various inquiries. I had an initial discussion with 2 investors before I was able to close a deal. The entire process took 3 months and I was successfully able to sell my company. My experience on the platform was amazing and therefore I would recommend SMERGERS to any entrepreneur/ business owner who is looking to raise funds or sell their company.</p>

									<p>I had posted a business for sale on SMERGERS which was difficult to find a buyer for otherwise due to the size of the deal. Initially, it took a bit of time to start receiving introductions, but I’m glad I was finally able to close the deal with someone. In all, it took 9 months to find a serious buyer and only 2 months to close the deal with him. It’s a genuine site with genuine buyers, that I’m very happy about. None of the investors were fake and were there for serious business interest.</p>

									<p>First you should be an honest person and your business proposal should be based on honesty is the best policy. You shouldn't be hiding anything from the investor. You have to first represent yourself and then your business product related information including present and future planning. It may take 2 to 3 months depending on how you represent your interest to an investor. I found a Japanese investor and we have already registered our partnership business under LLP. In my case, both the Japanese partner and I trust each other equally. We listen to each other very carefully and then respond.</p>

I haven't come across another equivalent platform that provides opportunities for investors like me to transform into the world of Investment. I will highly recommend this platform./p>

									<p>We were looking for an investment for our pathology laboratory business located in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. We needed investment for marketing and promotions so we registered on Oct 2019 by creating our profile. An analyst called us to verify the details, took some more business information and activated the profile within 24 hours. We connected with 15-20 investors from different locations in a span of 2 months. I actually came across more than enough good deals through this website and we finally settled with the better deal out of all the offers we received. We managed to get an investment within just 3 months from creating a profile on SMERGERS. I should say it really helped me to find a business partner and made it easy. It is a well laid out website and most of the investors I came across were genuinely interested in our business. I would give 9.5 out of 10 for the experience, overall rating, and support from SMERGERS</p>

									<p>The team at SMERGERS which worked with us to build the Franchise brochure and ROI model for Y5home was reliable and pleasant to interact with. In fact, working with them helped us better understand and also refine our distributorship model to ensure that our distributors would be profitable at the earliest. Final documents delivered by them were of very high quality and made an excellent impression amongst potential distributors we spoke with. Other franchise companies charge a bomb and don't even deliver half of what these guys deliver. Happy with the work of SMERGERS and I do recommend people to have faith in them and go with the good brand.</p>

With most of the investors, the only term that we could not get on the table was with respect to equity, apart from that everything was fine. I was able to close the deal with one them last week. In all, it took around 3 months to successfully find an investor through www.smergers.com. It is a user-friendly platform and it's been a good experience overall.</p>

									<p>I did several transactions on SMERGERS and I believe I profited from the website. Initially, I acquired a section 25 company through their platform which was available at a very reasonable valuation. Next using the same, I set up a microfinance company with typical loan size between Rs.50,000 to Rs.5 lakh. Again using their website I connected with several companies looking for small loans and have financed them through the microfinance company. I have tried other online portals too but using SMERGERS was easy compared to others. There are some genuine businesses listed which provide us a fair deal.</p>

Though a few business owners were not very responsive, I connected with some very good restaurants which were for sale in the areas I was looking for. I finally bought a multi-cuisine restaurant in a residential hub in Kolkata which I found on their website. You can definitely try their website for buying or selling a small business.</p>

									<p>It was indeed a pleasure to interact with smergers.com in my startup Slavonic Technologies Pvt Ltd. We were doing great, however, there was a time when I had to switch to another project and startup, hence I posted my details in smergers. Honestly speaking the responses received via smergers were few but all of them were quality responses. It definitely denotes that smergers does the due-diligence. I got responses for investment, however, I was willing for a full sell out, which I was able to do from the response received via smergers. After meeting the prospective buyer the deal was closed and it was acquired. I must thank Smergers for providing such a great platform where businesses of any scale/volume can come and interact with each other.</p>

I was happy with their step by step guidance and their process to build the CIM which was completed within the committed timeline. The quality of documents and inputs from SMERGERS to present my business for sale was very professional. I was able to use them for talks with buyers for my enterprise.

									<p>Well the thing when you start out is most platforms express an elaborate pitch, writing a presentation and then make a huge deal out of something that isn’t what small organisations are looking for. It seems to have become a trend that all investors form a club and then make it a social deal. We had been seeking investments for quite sometime and almost all Angel and VC clubs (please note that these are not platforms but clubs for the so called investors) are mostly interested in IT startups. I cam across SMERGERS on google and I did sign up (for free) and then made a payment to become a registered member. They did go through a verification process. The initial few interests that I had were not even remotely close, but that I guess is natural. I had 3 genuine interests and one of them was after we had closed the deal. The best thing was, all of them were associated with my field of business, they had interest in what my ideas were, what details had been worked out and what was the investment for. Trust me we closed a USD 200k deal over a 20 min phone call and 4 back and forth emails with some minimal paperwork checks. This was essentially because we came from the same background and relating words to business was easy. I traveled to the US, met with the investor and spent a day understanding. We were both comfortable and moved ahead to contractual bindings.</p>

Soon after registration got an enquiry from Dubai but initial deal with them failed. After a month, many of the investors we connected with were new to this industry and had questions on our multi-speciality hospital. SMERGERS shared a questionnaire which I had to fill and came out with a simple information memorandum of our organization clearly explaining our business. It is nice to have a good document while searching for investors which is crisp and highlights our business in a unique manner. Recently, I have upgraded for another 80 proposals till 2019. Hope the team will support our company till we achieve our objective.</p>
