It gives them a way to reduce or liquidate stake in a business and if the business is successful make a substantial profit. It also helps to limit losses in case the business has not been successful.

Modern day technology and fewer entry barriers in most industries have changed the business landscape around the world. Starting a business now is easier than ever before in human history. However, starting is just the first step. Convincing people to work for your business or product idea, convincing customers to buy your product and most importantly convincing investors to put money into your business are the most challenging aspects for a business owner. Once you have put a strong business foundation and created an interesting product people want to buy, you will need to raise funds to grow or sell your business. Convincing a buyer is as challenging as convincing investors to invest in your business. </p>

                                        <p>Buying a business is generally cheaper than starting one. And what’s also important is that there are huge advantages that you get when buying a business rather than starting it from scratch. Entrepreneurship through acquisition, or buying a business gives you the added advantage of existing customer base, working marketing strategy, already hired employees, easy financing, avoiding delays of compliance and regulatory approvals, etc. But if you end up buying a business without proper due diligence it may cost you much more time, money and energy that what you would have spent starting one. Hence it is important to check the below listed aspects before you take the plunge.

                                        <p>In most countries, of all the registered companies only 60-70% of them are actively in business. Some businesses fail in their planning phase, some are declared dormant and some just run out of money.  For most of the young entrepreneurs out there, this is a harsh reality. You might think that your idea is good, but if not executed properly, it can be one of the worst mistakes you do in your life. A bad business will have heavy consequences and will drain your financial resources and time.

They are intermediaries between a business owner who’s selling their business and an acquirer who want to purchase it. They play an important role in sale of businesses in providing expertise needed to get the sale done, a trait most small business owners lack. Also, selling a business takes time, so working with a broker allows the business owner to focus on operating the business while the broker does the leg work required to complete the sale.

                                        <p>Buying an existing business from an owner who’s retiring, relocating or cashing out is a great way to become an entrepreneur. Buying is particularly interesting as most of the legwork is already done by the existing business owner. Plus, you don’t have to go through the long process of figuring out a business model that works, monetization techniques, etc. and go straight to expansion and growing profits.

                                        <p>For business owners, a great way to retain their business but still get some liquid cash is through selling a part of the business. That’s right – selling a business doesn’t mean you have to sell it completely. You can always sell a portion of it while holding onto the rest. The cash can be used for further growth of operations or get some liquidity. Selling a part of your business might be a better option for you and the business, if you plan and execute the strategy well.  Let’s start by exploring the use cases for selling a part of the business. </p>

Some do it to escape the monotony of working for a corporate outfit, while others do it to pursue a passion. Whatever the reason an entrepreneur has for pursuing a business, eventually he/she would think of selling the business to realize its full potential. There are several reasons why one would want to sell the business. It could be retirement, absence of succession planning, no legal heir, mental fatigue for the entrepreneur or simply, to cash out for the right offer. In this article, we’ll explore different steps one has to take before putting up a running business for sale.</p>
